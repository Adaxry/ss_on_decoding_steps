This is the third part of our major Good Health series on dementia . <S_SEP> We look at ways to help minimise the impact of memory problems . <S_SEP> For example , we need just as much sleep as we get older . <S_SEP> The problem is that older people find it harder to reach a deeper sleep . <S_SEP> When the short-term memory starts to go , it can make it hard for someone to recall what they have already done that day , such as whether they 've had breakfast , or showered , or spoken to someone . <S_SEP> It can help to keep a diary - a record of what has been done through the day . Writing also helps encourage the cognitive processes , which can help slow down future decline . <S_SEP> Create a memory hub - that is , a central place in the home , perhaps the dining room table or a desk , where important notes , car keys , house keys and drugs that need to be taken are kept .
